          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">The Challenge</h2>
          <p>Across Malaysia and the world, AI-driven algorithms quietly decide what we see, what we believe, and who gets heard. These systems often:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Amplify harassment & hate — 65% of young women in Malaysia face gendered abuse online, with algorithmic feeds boosting hate speech exposure by up to 70%.</li>
            <li>Lock youth into echo chambers — Over 60% say their feeds mostly reinforce existing beliefs, normalising harmful norms.</li>
            <li>Suppress activism — Opaque moderation “shadow bans” or deprioritises feminist and activist voices.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>For young people — regardless of gender — this creates a double bind: the same platforms that spark movements also become arenas of relentless abuse, shaping identities and beliefs in ways few can see, but all can feel.</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">Why We Started Alt//orithm</h2>
          <p>Our team’s activism has shown both the power and the peril of digital spaces. In 2021, the youth-led hashtag #MakeSchoolASaferPlace reached over 21.4 million views and helped reignite a 30-year push for Malaysia’s Anti-Sexual Harassment Bill, tabled in 2022.</p>
          <p>It was proof that digital advocacy can drive real policy change — but it also exposed a darker reality: as visibility grew, so did targeted harassment and online violence. These experiences led us to a question that now drives Alt//orithm: How do AI-driven algorithms shape gendered and polarised online experiences for youth — and how can these systems be reimagined to support feminist counter-narratives and youth-led digital activism?</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">Our Mission</h2>
          <p>Alt//orithm exists to interrupt harmful algorithmic patterns and redirect digital systems toward gender justice, civic participation, and youth empowerment. We combine community research, creative storytelling, and policy advocacy to:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Map how algorithms reinforce gendered harm and polarisation.</li>
            <li>Equip youth to take control of their digital feeds and narratives.</li>
            <li>Push for platform accountability without sacrificing freedom of expression.</li>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">Our Vision</h2>
          <p>Alt//orithm transforms youth from passive algorithm subjects into active shapers of their digital environments. By centring gender justice, amplifying diverse youth voices, and building cross-sector coalitions, we are creating a blueprint for an internet that liberates — not limits.</p>
          <p><strong>Take Back the Feed. Rewrite the Code.</strong></p>
          <p>The future of the internet is being written right now — in lines of code, in invisible rules that decide who gets heard and who gets hurt. We don’t have to accept an algorithm that thrives on outrage, silences activists, and normalises abuse.</p>
          <p>Alt//orithm is building the research, campaigns, and tools to shift the balance — but we can’t do it alone.</p>
          <p>Here’s how you can help write the first draft:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Join our founding network → Share your experiences and help us map how algorithms impact youth in Malaysia.</li>
            <li>Be part of the build → Get early access to workshops and be among the first to test our tools.</li>
            <li>Fuel the movement → Your support powers youth-led research, creative activism, and policy advocacy.</li>
          </ul>
